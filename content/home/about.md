The event will cover four topics, starting with a discussion on the challenges faced by data scientists in the field, followed by an exploration of MLOps practices derived from software engineering principles, adapted to evolving ML tools stack, and advocated by MLOps engineers across all companies dealing with data and ML models.

Next, we will step back and try to grasp the concepts involved in those emerging practices. What concepts are rebranded from other mature fields? How do researchers drive novelty in this field? What brand new concepts will be born as a result? 

Last but not least, we will hear from a leader in the responsible AI movement about recent developments in technology provided to ML practitioners to ensure ethical and responsible use of AI. We will also open the floor for discussion on potential risks and benefits associated with large language models like ChatGPT and LLMOps practices that need to be developed.

Don't miss out on this exciting event! Register now to join us for a day of informative talks and engaging discussions on MLOps.

Stay tuned!
