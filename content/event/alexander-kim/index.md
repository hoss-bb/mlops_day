abstract: Discover the power of Data Version Control (DVC) and its integration with VS Code via the DVC Extension in this talk. We will introduce DVC's core features, including data versioning, pipeline management, and model tracking, and demonstrate how it enhances collaboration and reproducibility in ML projects. Next, we will explore the DVC Extension for VS Code, which offers a user-friendly interface for managing DVC projects within the code editor. Learn how to visualize, reproduce and compare experiments easily. By the end of the session, attendees will be equipped to streamline their ML workflows and ensure reproducibility in their projects.
