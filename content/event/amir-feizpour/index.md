abstract: DevOps and MLOps have transformed software development over the past two decades, but now we are seeing a further shift left with the rise of KnowledgeOps. This new era leverages tools to augment our problem-solving, planning, and critical thinking abilities, enabling us to tackle highly complex knowledge work with greater efficiency and effectiveness. KnowledgeOps promises to enhance our ability to experiment with a wider range of ideas and select the most impactful ones, similar to the benefits seen in DevOps and related methodologies.
