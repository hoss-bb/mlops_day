abstract: The gaming industry has come a long way from its humble beginnings, but one thing that remains constant is the desire for a richer, personalized and safer experience. In today's world, machine learning is the driving force behind this desire. However, deploying machine learning models quickly and efficiently is critical to achieving this goal. Jean\-Michel will share his insights and expertise from his experience as a data scientist at Ubisoft (without a computer science background), operating machine learning pipelines in production and supporting the development and usage of a machine learning platform internally.
