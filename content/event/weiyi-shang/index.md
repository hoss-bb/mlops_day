abstract: Software systems usually record important runtime information in their logs. Logs help practitioners understand system runtime behaviors and diagnose field failures. As logs are usually very large in size, automated log analysis is needed to assist practitioners in their software operation and maintenance efforts. The success of adopting log analysis in practice often depends on sophisticated infrastructures. In particular, to enable fast queries and to save storage space, such infrastructure split log data into small blocks (e.g., 16KB), then index and compress each block separately. Afterwards a log parsing step converts the raw logs from unstructured text to a structured format before applying subsequent log analysis techniques. My lab specializes in the development of approaches for advancing the infractures of log analysis. In this talk, I provide an overview of some of our recent work on automated techniques of log compression and parsing.
